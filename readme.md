## Elizabeth Killgore Phase 1 Final Project Flatiron School
### A single page application named "Fine Art Appreciation"

The purpose of this application is to allow a user to appreciate works of art listed and referred to in the application section "Today's Twelve Chosen Works of Art Listed Below".  The chosen works of art change periodically.  The image borders at the top and at the bottom of the page are not necessarily included in the twelve chosen pieces.  A user can comment on one or more of the twelve works by writing inside the comment box and pressing the submit button.  They can then clear the box and write another comment and submit again and the comments will list in the "My Comments" section. They can make multiple comments and they can erase their comments, individually, by marking the 'x' box next to the comment in the list.

In the future, this application will include images associated with each of the twelve chosen works of art, rather than just text of title, artist information, and date first displayed.  One source to see the images referred to in the chosen works is to go to the Art Institute of Chicago website at artic.edu.  There you can choose The Collection, then search by title, or search by artist, and view the work of art.

Please note the following acknowledgements:
The images used in this application come via Art Institute of Chicago.  Helpful suggestions and advice for the project can be attributed to Ryan Parrish, Instructor at Flatiron School.  

Contriubtions are not requested at this time.  This application is a work in progress, but in the interest of time, is submitted as is.
